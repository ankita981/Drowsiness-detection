# Drowsiness-detection
'Distributed Tracking of Edge Node', focuses on a driver drowsiness detection and alert system. We used OpenCV for image processing, dlib for facial landmark detection, and the Haarcascade algorithm to detect facial features like eyes and mouth. By calculating the eye aspect ratio (EAR) and mouth aspect ratio (MAR), we can detect signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eye closure or yawning. When drowsiness is detected, we use Pygame to trigger sound alerts in real-time. The system runs efficiently on edge devices, making it ideal for in-vehicle use to enhance road safety.
